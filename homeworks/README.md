- HW1: Audio-Text CLAP on AudioCaps
  
Homework focuses on training a CLAP-style audio–text model on the AudioCaps dataset: frozen audio and CLIP text encoders produce embeddings, a linear projection maps audio vectors into the CLIP text space via contrastive loss, and the resulting model is evaluated on an audio retrieval/classification task using accuracy@k against a random baseline.
